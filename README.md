# Redundant things

These pages are about raising redundant services.

Topics covered include:

* [Virtual IPs](virtual-ips/):  
The first building block for making most services redundant.
* [Recursive DNS](dns-recursive/):  
An easy stateless* service which supports high availability through the use of virtual IPs.

\* cache is not considered a state here
