# Virtual IPs turned up to 11

The introductory article provided an active/failover configuration. There is nothing wrong with this, and sometimes it's the preferred configuration. Active/active can be achived for some services, but knowing when to implement it is key to succeeding in an active/active setup.

## When to go active/passive instead of active/active

Active/passive setups provide predictable performance for both the best case and worst case availability of the service in question. Since only one server is active at a time, you can expect the same performance if a server goes offline and another takes over.

## When to go active/active

Active/active setups can lead to higher performance at the cost of skewing the worst case and best case performance of the service in question.

Not all services can be made active/active, even if you can configure the environment to make both servers simultaneously answer for a given service.

### How to go active/active

To go active/active, clients accessing your service must have a way of hitting any of the servers in the pool. This can be accomplished with a load balancer, however the load balancer then becomes a single point of failure. You can instead leverage DNS round robin to give a roughly 50% distribution of incoming requests between two or more IP addresses.

This example assumes two servers are hosting static content with no state. For example, a static webpage.

Configure two A records for a given hostname/FQDN.

    hostname	IN  A	192.0.2.2
    hostname	IN  A	192.0.2.3

Clients should pick one at random at roughly a 50% distribution.

This is a good start, but it requires us to update DNS if we want to take one of the servers down for maintenance or if we want to react to an unexpected server outage.

On both servers, configure **TWO** VRRP instances with sequential IPs in the same subnet as above. On the first server, set the first VIP as priority 200 and the second as priority 100. On the second server, set the first VIP as priority 100 and the second as priority 200. Set the higher priority of each to MASTER and the lower to BACKUP. See below example.

**Server 1**

    vrrp_instance vrrp_1 {
      state MASTER
      interface eth0
      virtual_router_id 1
      advert_int 1
      priority 200
      authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass SECUREUNIQUEPASSWORD
      }
      virtual_ipaddress {
        192.0.2.4/24
      }
    }
    vrrp_instance vrrp_2 {
      state BACKUP
      interface eth0
      virtual_router_id 1
      advert_int 1
      priority 100
      authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass SECUREUNIQUEPASSWORD
      }
      virtual_ipaddress {
        192.0.2.5/24
      }
    }

**Server 2**

    vrrp_instance vrrp_1 {
      state BACKUP
      interface eth0
      virtual_router_id 1
      advert_int 1
      priority 100
      authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass SECUREUNIQUEPASSWORD
      }
      virtual_ipaddress {
        192.0.2.4/24
      }
    }
    vrrp_instance vrrp_2 {
      state MASTER
      interface eth0
      virtual_router_id 1
      advert_int 1
      priority 200
      authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass SECUREUNIQUEPASSWORD
      }
      virtual_ipaddress {
        192.0.2.5/24
      }
    }

Now update your DNS records to contain the VIPs:

    hostname	IN  A	192.0.2.4
    hostname	IN  A	192.0.2.5

If one of the servers goes offline the other will assume its VIP and serve requests on both VIPs, requiring no manual changes to DNS to mitigate the offline server.
