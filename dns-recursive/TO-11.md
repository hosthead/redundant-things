# Recursive DNS servers turned up to 11

Building upon the deployment of the DNS server, a deployment of two or more servers can be made highly available and redundant by adding in [Virtual IPs](../virtual-ips).

Deploy 2 DNS servers per the instructions at [README.md](README.md), then configure two keepalived VIPs per the instructions at [Virtual IPs to 11](../virtual-ips/TO-11.md). Set the first VIP to be highest priority on the first DNS server, and the second VIP to be highest priority on the second DNS server. If either of the DNS servers goes offline, the other one will pick up the VIP and the slack. This permits you to always have 2 IPs answering DNS even if only one server is available. Alternatively, you can have three or more DNS servers in fenced groups per VIP. Two is the minimum. Configure your clients to use the VIPs instead of the management IPs of the DNS servers to complete this setup.
